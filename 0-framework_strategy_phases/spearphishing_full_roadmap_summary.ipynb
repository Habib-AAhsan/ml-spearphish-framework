    "# 🧠 Spear-Phishing Detection System: 4-Phase Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook summarizes the complete evolution of your intelligent spear-phishing detection framework — from MVP to autonomous threat response.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a fast, functional, end-to-end spear-phishing classifier using TF-IDF and interpretable models like Logistic Regression or XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "- Fast development and demonstration\n",
    "- Create benchmark accuracy\n",
    "- Provide explainable results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "- Preprocessing pipeline\n",
    "- TF-IDF vectorization\n",
    "- Traditional classifier (LogReg/XGBoost)\n",
    "- Evaluation (confusion matrix, F1, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 Phase 2: Deep NLP with Transformers (BERT/DistilBERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace or augment traditional models with deep contextual understanding via transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "- Improve detection of sophisticated, language-based phishing attacks\n",
    "- Enable transfer learning on custom corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Tools:\n",
    "- `transformers`, `datasets` (HuggingFace)\n",
    "- Tokenization and attention-based encoding\n",
    "- Fine-tuning with `Trainer` and evaluation on validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Phase 3: Real-Time Feedback + Adaptive Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Make the system self-improving by incorporating real-world feedback into the model via human-in-the-loop training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "- Monitor false positives and false negatives\n",
    "- Store edge cases and retrain periodically\n",
    "- Build live APIs for prediction and logging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools & Strategies:\n",
    "- `FastAPI`, `Redis`, `MLflow`\n",
    "- Incremental fine-tuning using `resume_from_checkpoint=True`\n",
    "- Confidence-based sample selection for active learning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Phase 4: Retaliation & Threat Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "Add proactive defense by integrating threat intelligence APIs and triggering automated or suggested response actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "- Connect with external sources (e.g., AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal)\n",
    "- Implement quarantine, alerts, blacklists\n",
    "- Build recommender for response actions\n",
    "- (Optional) Create honeypots or fake login traps in sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools:\n",
    "- `requests` for threat APIs\n",
    "- Internal rule-based engine\n",
    "- Optional reinforcement logic for future automation\n",
